# Master_Mind_GA

Here lies my Code from the online Genetic Algorithms course.

A course designed to learn genetic algorithms by contructing one to solve a "Master Mind" game, where a player invents a _secret code_ and the other player, in this case the algorithm, by trial and error gets to _reveal_ that code.
